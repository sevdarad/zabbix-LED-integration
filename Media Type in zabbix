In Zabbix, a Media Type refers to the method or channel used for sending alerts and notifications. In other words, the Media Type determines how and through what means the alert message is delivered to the user. Zabbix has several default media types for sending alerts, such as email, SMS, or voice messages. However, you can also create custom media types to suit your specific needs.
