Here is the script written for the Zabbix Media Type:

-------------------
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket

HOST = '192.168.31.75'  
PORT = 50007

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((HOST, PORT))

message = "255.0.0"  
client_socket.sendall(message.encode())

data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print(f"server_Response: {data.decode()}")

client_socket.close()

-------------------
This script connects to a server (at 192.168.31.75 on port 50007) and sends a message ("255.0.0", which likely represents a color or alert code for the LED). After sending the message, the script waits for a response from the server and then prints it before closing the connection.
The script can be modified to work with Zabbix by integrating it into a custom Media Type that triggers when an alert occurs.
